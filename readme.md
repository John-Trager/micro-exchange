# Micro-Exchange
A super simple stock exchange written in python.

The goal of this project is to make a super simple and robust limit orderbook exchange using python. We aim to support multiple tickers (or stocks/assets) on an exchange.

<i>This is a work in progress...</i>

## TODO
- tracking orders
- client api
- networking
- request queue?
    - zmq? just a python queue? (needs to be decoupled I think)
